# this is a Readme
This is a basic site about the beautiful and fascinating parks of Australia.

On this site you can read all about my travels to different parks, see photos, and find links to park websites.

This sample site is an example of using the core of Joomla! to create a basic website, whether a "brochure site,"  a personal blog, or as a way to present information on a topic you are interested in.

Read more about the site in the About Parks module.
